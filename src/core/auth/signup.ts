 * So registration is closed unless it is deliberately opened, and the
 * default has to be the safe one: a setting you must remember to change
 * before going live is a setting that will be forgotten.
 *
 * The exception is the empty installation. A fresh checkout with no users
 * at all lets the first person through, because otherwise nobody could
 * ever get in and every new installation would start with a chicken-and-egg
 * problem solved by hand-editing the database. The window closes by itself
